# ThinkyTots - MiniHackathon 2.0 Project 🚀

**ThinkyTots** is a fun and educational project created during the **MiniHackathon 2.0**, hosted by **Kevin Chromik**. The hackathon's theme focused on learning, and participants were challenged to develop projects that align with this goal.

## 💡 Idea Behind ThinkyTots  

Initially, the idea was to create a vocabulary app. However, considering that this might be a common approach, I decided to develop something unique and engaging for children. With limited time during the hackathon week, I aimed to create a platform tailored for kids.  

**Total Development Time**: ~10 hours

## 📚 Project Overview  

**ThinkyTots** is a playful and interactive platform with educational mini-games designed to stimulate young minds. It encourages exploration, learning, and fun through simple, age-appropriate activities.

### Features  
1. **Jungle Jam** 🐾  
   - A game where children listen to animal sounds and guess which animal made the sound.  
   - Players choose from three options and confirm their answer.  

2. **Shape Hunter** 🔺  
   - Displays shapes like triangles, circles, or squares, and players must identify the correct one.  
   - Promotes early geometry skills and recognition.  

3. **Sort It** 🔢  
   - A game where children arrange random numbers (1–100) in ascending order.  
   - Enhances problem-solving and logical thinking.

## 🌟 Planned Features  

In the future, I aim to expand **ThinkyTots** with additional games and interactive elements to make the platform even more engaging for children:

1. **Light Blink Game** ✨  
   - **Description**: Colored lights (e.g., Red, Green, Blue) blink in a specific sequence. Children need to repeat the sequence by clicking on the lights in the correct order.  
   - **Implementation**:  
     - Use simple sequences and `setTimeout` for animations.  
     - Clicking on the correct fields progresses the game to the next level.  
   - **Why This Game?**: It’s straightforward and uses pre-defined logic, perfect for young learners to develop memory and pattern recognition.

2. **Pop the ABC** 🎈  
   - **Description**: Balloons with letters float upwards, and children can click on them to hear the corresponding letter and learn its sound.  
   - **Interactive Element**: When clicked, the balloon pops and says something like "A, for Apple."  
   - **Why This Game?**: It encourages playful learning of the alphabet and phonics, making it an effective tool for early literacy.  

3. **and more...**
